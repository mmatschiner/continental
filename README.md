# README

This code repository includes the scripts used in Matschiner et al. (to be submitted) to estimate the genomic timeline of cichlid diversification across continents.

Note that the scripts should not be expected to run on your system from beginning to end, as they do contain commands specificy for the infrastructure on which the code was executed, and because assembly input files still need to be manually added to the directories in [ortholog_identification/data/subjects/local](ortholog_identification/data/subjects/local) (these were too large to be included in the repository). The files named REQUIRED_FILES in those directories indicate which files are required.
